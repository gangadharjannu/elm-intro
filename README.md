# elm
## Introduction
see [elm](http://elm-lang.org/) 
> A delightful language for reliable webapps.

I just started trying elm and syntax is looking like a pseudo-code.

I have been programming in object oriented style using Javascript, AngularJS and when I looked at elm code, syntax is entirely different from most programming languages I've known.

Checkout [counter.elm](https://github.com/gangadharjannu/elm-intro/blob/master/counter.elm)  file which contains the example code from [elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/buttons.html)

In the couner.elm file I've written comments for most the elm code
